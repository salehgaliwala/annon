= Plugin Description =
The famous database browser & manager (for MySQL & MariaDB) - use it inside WordPress Dashboard without an extra hassle.

== NOTES ==
* PHP >= 7.2.5 is required to for <strong>phpMyAdmin</strong> latest version (otherwise you will have option to use older version of PMA, which is not encouraged to be used).
* This plugin has been started from 2018 year, and we have no connections to the old age's vulnerable <b>wp-phpMyAdmin</b> plugin (published elsewhere by 3rd party scammers) . So, this current plugin is just a wrapper for official phpMyAdmin release and depends itself on the realiability & security of the `phpMyAdmin` itself. Also, initially we wanted to put PhpMyAdmin released `.zip` file untouched (to ensure the checksums are same) and unpack that `.zip` directly upon plugin's installation, but unfortunately WordPress Plugin Team didn't allow to put `.zip` file in the package (saying that SVN doesn't like working with `.zip` files). Thus, we had to submit extracted PMA (but still original & untouched) to the repository.
* For the reason to make it compact, some extra or unnecessary files (language files,GIS map, etc) are removed.
* It's recommended, that you enable the plugin only while you need to use PhpMyAdmin. Otherwise, for longer periods, you can deactivate plugin.

= Liability =
We are not developers of PhpMyAdmin itself, neither affiliated with them. We just made this plugin as a wrapper (container) of PhpMyAdmin, so, people could use it in WP. This plugin uses official, unmodified (only whatever mentioned above) PhpMyAdmin package. However, we don't control, check or revise the PhpMyAdmin package's source code ot behavior itself, and thus, in overall, we take no responsibility about this plugin. Use it at your own responsibility (However, not more than 1% of users complained about having issues after using the plugin).

= Available Options =
