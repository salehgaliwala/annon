## ⭐ Custom Post Type (Full WordPress default options) 

Custom post types allow you to create custom content types for your WordPress site beyond the default options of posts and pages. For example, if you want to build a movie database like IMDB, you could use a custom post type called 'Movies' to store and display information about individual movies. This is especially useful when the default post types don't meet the needs of a specific industry or niche. With custom post types, you have the flexibility to create content that is tailored to your specific needs.

## ⭐ Custom Taxonomy (Full WordPress default options)


Organize your custom post types with custom taxonomies to improve search, filtering, and data structure on both the front and back end of your site. Using custom taxonomies, you can group your custom post types in a way that makes it easier to find and access the content you need.


## ⭐ Custom Fields

Custom fields allow you to add extra details and customization to your post types and taxonomies, giving you greater control over your advanced website projects. The CubeWP framework includes 25 field types to choose from, giving you plenty of options for adding custom fields to your site.
