## LeadGen & Contact Form by CubeWP – Drag & Drop Form Builder for WordPress

== Description ==

CubeWP Forms is a 100% free extension for the [CubeWP Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cubewp-framework/) (also available for FREE on WordPress.org) that lets you easily build simple or advanced contact forms, 
lead forms, feedback forms, and other types of forms for your website using a drag-and-drop form builder and manage the leads.

In addition to serving as a simple contact or lead form, CubeWP Forms can also be used for more advanced purposes.

To create a powerful form you need access to advanced custom fields. CubeWP Forms includes 25 custom fields out-of-the box. 
Many of the custom fields included are only available in paid add-ons otherwise. See the list of all custom fields below.

Some of the key features that make it a powerful form builder include the ability for administrators to view and manage lead messages from the backend, as well as the option to configure forms to send instant notification to specific email addresses.

With CubeWP Forms, you can quickly and easily create forms that meet your specific needs and help you capture valuable lead information or feedback from your visitors.

With our premium add-on, [CubeWP Frontend Pro](https://cubewp.com/cubewp-frontend-pro/), you can also allow users (post authors, listing owners, etc.) to view and manage leads from the frontend user dashboard. This feature provides an easy and convenient way for users to access and interact with leads on your site. 

If you want to enable this functionality, be sure to check out [CubeWP Frontend Pro](https://cubewp.com/cubewp-frontend-pro/).
